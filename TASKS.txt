create operadores subtree to store user data like proper name, email

when typing cliente codigo, if there is no match, show a link "criar novo",
when this is clicked, a text field pops up and autosaves new data

if Desistencia, then do not subtract from container totals (Chegando)

Does callback to child_modified provide previous values?

Count total number of line items per container, to verify against physical
paper copies

find a way to store container number, when changing status to Reserva (add
callback to child_modified?)

how to handle multiple chegandos on same item? could tally by codigo and
concatenate the multiple containers into a string

line item's container label should be auto-computed

LineItems table should be sortable by column heading, like tablesorter.
Double-clicking reverses sort

add created and last modified timestamps (new Date()).getTime()
